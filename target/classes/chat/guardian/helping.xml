    <message> Guardian> Help? Oh, sure, as long as you don't need emotional support!</message>
    <message> Guardian> I charge by the minute, you know that, right?</message>
    <message> Guardian> Sure, I'll help. But what's in it for me?</message>
    <message> Guardian> Saving the world again? Man, you guys are needy!</message>
    <message> Guardian> Alright, but if this goes wrong, it’s totally your fault!</message>
    <message> Guardian> Let me guess, you broke something... again.</message>
    <message> Guardian> Help? I was just about to take a nap, but okay.</message>
    <message> Guardian> I’ll help, but you owe me a pizza after this.</message>
    <message> Guardian> Fine, but next time, ask someone else!</message>
    <message> Guardian> Ugh, I was just about to finish my coffee!</message>
    <message> Guardian> Helping you is like putting a band-aid on a volcano, but sure!</message>
    <message> Guardian> If I had a coin for every time you asked for help, I’d be rich!</message>
    <message> Guardian> You sure you want my help? I mean... really sure?</message>
    <message> Guardian> Let me guess... you didn't read the manual again?</message>
    <message> Guardian> Helping is my middle name. Well, not really, but let's go with it.</message>
    <message> Guardian> Alright, alright! But I’m not doing all the work!</message>
    <message> Guardian> Only if you promise not to make a bigger mess this time.</message>
    <message> Guardian> Okay, but if we die, it’s your fault!</message>
    <message> Guardian> I’ll help, but you better not be dragging me into something dangerous... again!</message>
    <message> Guardian> Help? Sure, but you’re buying dinner after this!</message>
